# Tongue Tied Tale - GMTK 2024
Tongue Tied Tale is a platformer game featuring a chameleon who loves to eat! Play as a hungry reptile that'll consume everything in its pathâ€”even its enemies... Use your tongue to traverse unique puzzles and obstacles. Control platforms to access more delicious fruit. Fight enemies and eat them as a reward! Eat to gain weight, and run or drink potions to shed any excess mass. A heavy chameleon can be handy in a scrap, but can also weigh you down, so make sure to keep your eye on the scale!
